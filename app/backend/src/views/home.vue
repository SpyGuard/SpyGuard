            <p>SpyGuard is a forked and enhanced version of TinyCheck, an application developed by Kaspersky. SpyGuard's main objective is to detect signs of compromise by monitoring network flows transmitted by a device.</p>
            <p>As it uses WiFi, SpyGuard can be used against a wide range of devices, such as smartphones, laptops, IOTs or workstations. To do its job, the analysis engine of SpyGuard is using Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), anomaly detection and is supported by Suricata. </p>

            <p>This backend lets you configure your SpyGuard instance. You can push some IOCs for detection and whitelist elements which can be seen during legit communications in order to prevent false positives.</p>
